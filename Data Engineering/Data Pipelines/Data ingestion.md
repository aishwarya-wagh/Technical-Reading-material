## 1. Introduction
Data ingestion is the process of obtaining and importing data for immediate use or storage in a database. It is a crucial step in enabling organizations to harness the power of their data for analysis and decision-making. Efficient data ingestion pipelines are essential for processing vast amounts of data quickly and reliably, ensuring high data quality and consistency.

## 2. Data Ingestion Basics
Data ingestion is the first step in the data engineering lifecycle, involving the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from various sources into a storage system. This process can be divided into two main types: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform). The choice between these methods depends on the specific requirements and architecture of the data system.

## 3. Types of Data Ingestion
Data ingestion can be categorized into three main types: batch ingestion, real-time ingestion, and micro-batch ingestion.

### 3.1 Batch Ingestion
Batch ingestion involves collecting data over a period and then processing it in bulk. This method is suitable for scenarios where real-time processing is not necessary, such as end-of-day reports, data archiving, and periodic analysis.

### 3.2 Real-time Ingestion
Real-time ingestion involves continuous data flow and immediate processing as it is generated. This is crucial for time-sensitive applications such as fraud detection, real-time analytics, and monitoring systems. Real-time ingestion requires low latency and high availability to ensure timely and accurate data processing.

### 3.3 Micro-batch Ingestion
Micro-batch ingestion is a hybrid approach where data is collected in small batches and processed frequently. This method balances the trade-offs between batch and real-time ingestion, providing a compromise between latency and resource utilization. Micro-batch ingestion is often used in streaming platforms and real-time analytics systems.
