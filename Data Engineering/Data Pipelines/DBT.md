## Basic Questions

### Q1: What is dbt and what are its main features?
**Answer**: dbt (data build tool) is a transformation tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse more effectively. Its main features include:
- SQL-based transformations.
- Modular and reusable SQL models.
- Built-in testing and data quality checks.
- Automatic documentation generation.
- Integration with version control systems like Git.

### Q2: How does dbt differ from traditional ETL tools?
**Answer**: Traditional ETL tools handle the extraction, transformation, and loading of data in a single process, often using proprietary languages or interfaces. dbt focuses solely on the transformation layer (T), allowing users to write transformations using SQL. It integrates with existing EL (Extract and Load) tools to provide a more modular and flexible approach to data processing.

### Q3: What are dbt models and how are they used?
**Answer**: dbt models are SQL files that define data transformations. They are used to transform raw data into a more usable format for analysis. Models are stored in the `models` directory and can reference each other using the `ref` function to manage dependencies.

### Q4: Can you explain the directory structure of a dbt project?
**Answer**: A typical dbt project directory structure includes:
- `models/`: Contains SQL files for your transformations.
- `data/`: Optional directory for seed files to load static data.
- `snapshots/`: Contains snapshot files to capture the state of your data at specific points in time.
- `macros/`: Contains reusable SQL snippets.
- `tests/`: Contains custom tests.
- `analysis/`: Contains ad-hoc queries and analyses.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation files.
- `dbt_project.yml`: Main configuration file for the dbt project.

### Q5: How do you configure a dbt project to connect to a data warehouse?
**Answer**: You configure a dbt project to connect to a data warehouse using the `profiles.yml` file. This file includes connection details such as the database type, host, user credentials, and other necessary parameters. Example configuration for a PostgreSQL connection:

```yaml
my_profile:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: localhost
      user: my_user
      password: my_password
      dbname: my_database
      schema: my_schema
```

## Workflow and Setup

### Q6: Can you walk me through a typical dbt workflow?
**Answer**: A typical dbt workflow includes:
- Setting up a dbt project with necessary configurations.
- Writing SQL models for data transformations.
- Defining dependencies using `ref`.
- Writing tests in `schema.yml` to ensure data quality.
- Generating documentation for models.
- Running transformations with `dbt run`.
- Scheduling and orchestrating dbt runs with tools like Airflow or dbt Cloud.

### Q7: How do you set up a dbt project?
**Answer**: To set up a dbt project:
- Install dbt using pip (`pip install dbt`).
- Create a new project using `dbt init project_name`.
- Configure the `profiles.yml` file to connect to your data warehouse.
- Define models, tests, and documentation within the project directory.

## Models and Dependencies

### Q8: How do you handle dependencies between models?
**Answer**: Dependencies between models in dbt are handled using the `ref` function. For example, if model B depends on model A, you would use `ref('model_A')` within model B's SQL file. dbt then ensures that model A is run before model B.

### Q9: What is a common use case for using the `source` function in dbt?
**Answer**: The `source` function in dbt is used to reference raw data sources that are outside the dbt-managed models, such as tables or views in the data warehouse. It is typically used in the staging layer to bring in raw data for initial transformation. Example:

```sql
select *
from {{ source('raw_schema', 'raw_table') }}
```

## Testing and Documentation

### Q10: How do you implement testing in dbt?
**Answer**: dbt allows you to write tests in `schema.yml` files. You can define tests for various data quality checks, such as uniqueness, null values, and relationships. For example:

```yaml
models:
  - name: my_model
    columns:
      - name: id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
```

### Q11: How do you document your dbt models?
**Answer**: Documentation in dbt is done using doc blocks in `schema.yml` files. You can describe models, columns, and their relationships. dbt can generate HTML documentation with `dbt docs generate` and `dbt docs serve`.

## Advanced and Tricky Questions

### Q12: How does dbt handle incremental models, and what are some best practices for using them?
**Answer**: Incremental models in dbt allow you to process only new or changed data rather than reprocessing the entire dataset. To define an incremental model, you use the `is_incremental()` function and specify the logic for handling new data. Best practices include:
- Ensuring your data has a reliable unique key or timestamp.
- Using the `unique_key` configuration to identify new rows.
- Regularly full-refreshing the incremental model to maintain data integrity.

### Q13: How do you debug a failing dbt model?
**Answer**: To debug a failing dbt model:
- Check the error message and logs to understand the failure.
- Ensure the SQL syntax is correct and the necessary tables exist.
- Validate the dependencies using `dbt deps`.
- Use the `dbt debug` command to verify the connection to the data warehouse.
- Run individual models with `dbt run -m model_name` to isolate issues.

### Q14: Explain the difference between `ref` and `source` in dbt.
**Answer**: The `ref` function is used to reference other dbt models within your project, ensuring dependencies are managed. The `source` function is used to reference raw data sources outside of dbt-managed models, such as tables or views in the data warehouse. `source` is typically used in the staging layer to bring in raw data for initial transformation.

### Q15: How do you manage sensitive information in dbt projects?
**Answer**: Managing sensitive information in dbt involves:
- Using environment variables to store sensitive data, which can be referenced in `profiles.yml`.
- Keeping sensitive data out of version control by using `.gitignore` to exclude files.
- Using secrets management tools (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and retrieve sensitive information securely.
